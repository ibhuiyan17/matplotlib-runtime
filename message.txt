Hello again!

Just a few final notes now that the final is over and the semester is wrapping up! 

1. Final exam grades and final grades in the next couple of days
2. Exams in your MBox hopefully by the end of this week. 

Once again, check for any score adding errors and go through the returned exam. The process to get any mistakes fixed is a little bit different this time around, so keep an eye out on canvas and your email for more details on that end. 

Other than that, good luck with any remaining exams and have a wonderful winter break! As always let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you all again for a fabulous semester!
Katherine
